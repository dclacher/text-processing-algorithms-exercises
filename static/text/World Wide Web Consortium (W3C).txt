W3C Invites Implementations of Linked Data Platform 1.0 

 19 June 2014  | Archive <http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/3920> 

The Linked Data Platform (LDP) Working Group <http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/> 
invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation ofLinked Data Platform 
1.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-ldp-20140619/>. This document describes a set 
of best practices and simple approach for a read-write Linked Data 
architecture, based on HTTP access to web resources that describe their state 
using the RDF data model. Learn more about theData Activity 
<http://www.w3.org/2013/data/>.

Last Call: Vibration API, Ambient Light Events, HTML Media Capture 

 19 June 2014  | Archive <http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/3918> 

The Device APIs Working Group <http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/> has published 
three Last Call Working Drafts today:

 * Vibration API <http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-vibration-20140619/>. This 
specification defines an API that provides access to the vibration mechanism of 
the hosting device. Vibration is a form of tactile feedback. 
 * Ambient Light Events <http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-ambient-light-20140619/>
. This specification defines a means to receive events that correspond to a 
light sensor detecting the presence of a light. 
 * HTML Media Capture 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html-media-capture-20140619/>. The HTML Media 
Capture specification defines an HTML form extension that facilitates user 
access to a device’s media capture mechanism, such as a camera, or microphone, 
from within a file upload control. 
Comments on these three specifications are welcome through 24 July 2014. Learn 
more about theUbiquitous Web Applications Activity <http://www.w3.org/2007/uwa/>

W3C Invites Implementations of DOM Parsing and Serialization 

 17 June 2014  | Archive <http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/3912> 

The Web Applications Working Group <http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/> invites 
implementation of the Candidate Recommendation ofDOM Parsing and Serialization 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-DOM-Parsing-20140617/>. This specification 
defines various APIs for programmatic access to HTML and generic XML parsers by 
web applications for use in parsing and serializing DOM nodes.

The group also published a Working Draft of Shadow DOM 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-shadow-dom-20140617/>. This specification 
describes a method of combining multiple DOM trees into one hierarchy and how 
these trees interact with each other within a document, thus enabling better 
composition of the DOM.

Last Call: HTML5 

 17 June 2014  | Archive <http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/3908> 

The HTML Working Group <http://www.w3.org/html/wg/> has published a Last Call 
Working Draft ofHTML5 <http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html5-20140617/>. This 
specification defines the 5th major revision of the core language of the World 
Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features 
are introduced to help Web application authors, new elements are introduced 
based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention 
has been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an 
effort to improve interoperability. Comments are welcome through15 July 2014.

The group also published a Working Draft of HTML 5.1 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html51-20140617/>. HTML was primarily designed as 
a language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its 
general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to 
describe a number of other types of documents. The main area that has not been 
adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as Web 
Applications. This standard attempts to rectify this, while at the same time 
updating the HTML language to address issues raised in the past few years.

Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 (Core-AAM) First Public Working Draft and 
WAI-ARIA 1.1 updated Working Draft 

 12 June 2014  | Archive <http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/3896> 

The Protocols and Formats Working Group <http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF> today 
published a First Public Working Draft ofCore Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-core-aam-1.1-20140612/> (Core-AAM), which 
supports the updated Working Draft ofAccessible Rich Internet Applications 
(WAI-ARIA) 1.1 <http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-wai-aria-1.1-20140612/>. WAI-ARIA 
provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible 
user interface elements.WAI-ARIA <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria> is designed 
to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content, particularly 
web applications. Core-AAM describes how user agents should expose semantics of 
content languages to accessibilityAPIs across multiple content technologies 
(including much of WAI-ARIA). Core-AAM serves as the basis for other 
specifications to extend the mappings to specific technologies. Learn more from 
thecall for review e-mail

The Web Applications Working Group <http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/> has 
published three documents today:

 * A First Public Working Draft of DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent key Values 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-key-20140612/>. This 
specification defines the values for theKeyboardEvent.key attribute, which is 
defined as part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events 
Specification. The key attribute contains information about the character 
generated by the key event. 
 * A First Public Working Draft of DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent code Values 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-code-20140612/>. This 
specification defines the values for theKeyboardEvent.code attribute, which is 
defined as part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events 
Specification. The code value contains information about the key event that can 
use used identify the physical key being pressed by the user. 
 * A Working Draft of UI Events 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-uievents-20140612/>. This specification extends 
the events and features defined in DOM Events Level 3.
