What is Linked Data?

The Semantic Web is a Web of Data — of dates and titles and part numbers and 
chemical properties and any other data one might conceive of. The collection of 
Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SKOS, SPARQL, etc.) provides an 
environment where application canquery <> that data, draw inferences <> using 
vocabularies <>, etc. 

However, to make the Web of Data a reality, it is important to have the huge 
amount of data on the Web available in a standard format, reachable and 
manageable by Semantic Web tools. Furthermore, not only does the Semantic Web 
need access to data, butrelationships among data should be made available, too, 
to create aWeb of Data (as opposed to a sheer collection of datasets). This 
collection of interrelated datasets on the Web can also be referred to as 
Linked Data.

To achieve and create Linked Data, technologies should be available for a 
common format (RDF), to make either conversion or on-the-fly access to existing 
databases (relational, XML, HTML, etc). It is also important to be able to setup
query <> endpoints to access that data more conveniently. W3C provides a 
palette of technologies (RDF, GRDDL, POWDER, RDFa, the upcoming R2RML, RIF, 
SPARQL) to get access to the data.

What is Linked Data Used For?

Linked Data lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: large scale 
integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications 
listed in, saycollection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases 
<http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/> are essentially based on the 
accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at various level of 
complexities.

Examples

A typical case of a large Linked Dataset is DBPedia <http://dbpedia.org>, 
which, essentially, makes the content of Wikipedia available in RDF. The 
importance of DBPedia is not only that it includes Wikipedia data, but also 
that it incorporates links toother datasets on the Web, e.g., to Geonames 
<http://www.geonames.org/>. By providing those extra links (in terms of RDF 
triples) applications may exploit the extra (and possibly more precise) 
knowledge from other datasets when developing an application; by virtue of 
integrating facts from several datasets, the application may provide a much 
better user experience.

 Tim Berners-Lee's note on Linked Data 
<http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html> gives a succinct description 
of the Linked Data principles. The Semantic Web community also maintains alist 
of books <http://esw.w3.org/topic/SwBooks> on a W3C Wiki page. Some of those 
books are introductory in nature while others are conference proceedings or 
textbook that address more advanced topics. Details ofrecent and upcoming 
Semantic Web related talks <http://www.w3.org/2007/11/Talks/Semantic_Web.html>, 
given by theW3C Staff <http://www.w3.org/People/>, the staff of the W3C Offices 
<http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/>, and members of the W3C Working Groups 
are available separately; the slides are usually publicly available. The W3C 
also maintains acollection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases 
<http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/> that show how Semantic Web 
technologies, including Linked Data, are used in practice.
