 The widespread deployment of Web-enabled mobile devices (such as phones) make 
them a target of choice for content creators. Understanding their strengths and 
their limitations, and using technologies that fit these conditions are key to 
create success mobile-friendly Web content.

What is specific to authoring for mobile devices?

 <> Mobile Web Best Practices Flip Cards <> Summarize the Guidelines 

Ideally, site authors would be able to meet the growing demand for a quality 
mobile experience without changing a line of code. But the reality is that a 
site designed specifically with mobility in mind will always provide a much 
better user experience to mobile users, even when they are equipped with the 
device du jour.

The reasons for that include the challenges posed by network costs and delays, 
memory and CPU limitations, keyboard and pointing devices differences. As 
importantly, they feature a growing set of advantages with theirpersonal and 
always-available nature, and their increasingly context-aware capabilities. 

As a result, the mobile experience often merit its own set of design 
considerations, as discussed in a growing body of literature, including W3C’s
mobile Web authoring <> and device independent authoring <> guidelines. Mobile 
users operate in a very different usage context than PC users, and providing 
them with an experience customized to their needs is likely to be the best 
service to them.

A number of the barriers that mobile users face are similar to those 
experienced by people with disabilities 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences>. These similarities make it natural 
to aim atdeveloping Web sites that are accessible both for people with 
disabilities and for mobile devices <http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/>. The two 
reference documents in this space, theWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG) <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php> and the Mobile Web Best Practices 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/> have thus a number of links and similarities 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/>.

What technologies have been developed to fit mobile devices?

Over the past years, W3C has developed a number of Web technologies that 
explicitly take into account the specificities of mobile devices:

 * CSS Mobile <>, a profile of the cascading style sheet language that matches 
the need of mobile Web authors 
 * SVG Tiny <>, a profile of the Web’s scalable vector graphics format 
well-suited to the capabilities of mobile devices 
 * XHTML For Mobile <>, which defines a subset of XHTML for mobile 
The latest generation of mobile browsers are capable of using more advanced 
Web technologies, includingfeatures from HTML5 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/html#w3c_all>, CSS 2.1 and 3 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/css>, a number of rich JavaScript APIs 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/js>, opening the way for Web-based mobile 
applications <> (including widgets <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/widgets>).

The Mobile Web Initiative has set up a training program 
<http://www.w3.org/Mobile/training/> to help Web designers and content 
producers who are already familiar with the desktop world to become familiar 
with the Web as delivered on mobile devices.

Standards for Web Applications on Mobile 
<http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/> provide a complete overview of 
all the technologies in development in W3C that help making the Web the best 
platform for developing Web applications.
