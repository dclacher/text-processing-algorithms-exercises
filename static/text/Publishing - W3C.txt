 The Extensible Markup Language (XML) originally grew out of the technical 
publication community. People had been using the larger, more complex SGML 
standard to publish technical documentation, manuals, financial reports, books 
and much more, but they needed something that would fit in better with the 
World Wide Web, and that would have a lower total cost.

The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) came out of earlier work at ISO on 
DSSSL, the Document Styling and Semantics Specification Language, but adapted 
for XML.

What is XSL-FO?

XSL is in two parts. The first part, XSLT 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/transformation>, is used to transform XML 
documents into something that one can see how to format: in fact, for 
publishing, into the XML vocabulary that is thesecond part of XSL: XSL-FO.

XSL-FO, the Formatting Objects part of XSL, is an XML markup language for 
describing page layout and formatting.

You can use XSL-FO to publish even large or complex multilingual XML documents 
to HTML, PDF or other formats; you can include SVG diagrams and MathML 
formulas, as well as other foreign objects.

What is XSL-FO Used For?

You can find XSL-FO in use wherever automated publishing is needed: everything 
from bank statements to driving licenses, from text books to database reports. 
XSL-FO is also used by some organizations for brochures and magazines; it has 
more sophisticated formatting than HTML and CSS, but is still a standard.
