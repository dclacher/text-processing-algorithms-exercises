Most W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies. To 
accomplish this work, W3C followsprocesses <> that promote the development of 
high-quality standards based on the consensus of the community. W3C processes 
promote fairness, responsiveness, and progress, all facets of theW3C mission <>.

Intro to Standards

The W3C technical report development process <> is the set of steps and 
requirements followed by W3C Working Groups to standardize Web technology. 
Through this process, W3C seeks to maximize consensus about the content of a 
technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, to promote 
consistency amongspecifications <>, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the 
broader community. Learn more in theintroduction to the W3C Process <>.

Input to the W3C standards process may come from a variety of places, 
including:

 * W3C Workshops <> 
 * Incubator Groups <> 
 * Member Submissions <> 
 * Team Submissions <> 
Value of Creating Standards at W3C

W3C continues to evolve to provide the community a productive environment for 
creating Web standards. W3C standards:

 * are created following a consensus-based decision process; 
 * consider aspects of accessibility, privacy, security, and 
internationalization; 
 * reflect the views of diverse industries and global stakeholders; 
 * balance speed, fairness, public accountability, and quality; 
 * benefit from Royalty-Free patent licensing commitments 
<http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent/> from participants; 
 * are stable (and W3C seeks to ensure their persistence at the published URI);
 * benefit from wide review from groups inside and outside W3C; 
 * are downloadable at no cost; 
 * are maintained in a predictable fashion; 
 * are strengthened through interoperability testing;
