What is a Vocabulary?

On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also 
referred to as “terms”) used to describe and represent an area of concern. 
Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular 
application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible 
constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex 
(with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two 
concepts only).

There is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and 
“ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more complex, and 
possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas “vocabulary” is used when 
such strict formalism is not necessarily used or only in a very loose sense. 
Vocabularies are the basic building blocks forinference <> techniques on the 
Semantic Web.

What are Vocabularies Used For?

The role of vocabularies on the Semantic Web are to help data integration 
when, for example, ambiguities may exist on the terms used in the different 
data sets, or when a bit of extra knowledge may lead to the discovery of new 
relationships. Consider, for example, the application of ontologies in the 
field of health care. Medical professionals use them to represent knowledge 
about symptoms, diseases, and treatments. Pharmaceutical companies use them to 
represent information about drugs, dosages, and allergies. Combining this 
knowledge from the medical and pharmaceutical communities with patient data 
enables a whole range of intelligent applications such as decision support 
tools that search for possible treatments; systems that monitor drug efficacy 
and possible side effects; and tools that support epidemiological research.

Another type of example is to use vocabularies to organize knowledge. 
Libraries, museums, newspapers, government portals, enterprises, social 
networking applications, and other communities that manage large collections of 
books, historical artifacts, news reports, business glossaries, blog entries, 
and other items can now use vocabularies, using standard formalisms, to 
leverage the power oflinked data <>.

It depends on the application how complex vocabularies they use. Some 
applications may decide not to use even small vocabularies, and rely on the 
logic of the application program. Some application may choose to use very 
simple vocabularies like the one described in theexamples section below <>, and 
let a general Semantic Web environment use that extra information to make the 
identification of the terms. Some applications need an agreement on common 
terminologies, without any rigor imposed by a logic system. Finally, some 
applications may need more complex ontologies with complex reasoning 
procedures. It all depends on the requirements and the goals of the 
applications.

To satisfy these different needs, W3C offers a large palette of techniques to 
describe and define different forms of vocabularies in a standard format. These 
includeRDF and RDF Schemas <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all>, 
Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/skos#w3c_all>, Web Ontology Language (OWL) 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl#w3c_all>, and the Rule Interchange 
Format (RIF) <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rif#w3c_all>. The choice among 
these different technologies depend on the complexity and rigor required by a 
specific application.

Examples

A general example may help. A bookseller may want to integrate data coming 
from different publishers. The data can be imported into a common RDF model, 
eg, by using converters to the publishers’ databases. However, one database may 
use the term “author”, whereas the other may use the term “creator”. To make 
the integration complete, and extra definition should be added to the RDF data, 
describing the fact that the relationship described as “author” is the same as 
“creator”. This extra piece of information is, in fact, a vocabulary (or an 
ontology), albeit an extremely simple one.

In a more complex case the application may need a more detailed ontology as 
part of the extra information. This may include formal description on how 
authors are to be uniquely identified (eg, in a US setting, by referring to a 
unique social security number), how the terms used in this particular 
application relate to other datasets on the Web (eg, Wikipedia or geographic 
information), how the term “author” (or “creator”) can be related to terms like 
“editors”, etc.

introductory in nature while others are conference proceedings or textbook that 
address more advanced topics. Details ofrecent and upcoming Semantic Web

are available separately; the slides are usually publicly available. The W3C 
also maintains acollection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases 
<http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/> that show how Semantic Web 
technologies, including vocabularies, are used in practice. Finally, the
Semantic Web FAQ <> may also be of help in understanding the various concepts.
