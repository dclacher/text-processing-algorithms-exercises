Abstract

 This document defines a set of terms for describing people. It defines how to 
describe people's characteristics such as names or addresses and how to relate 
people to other things, for example to organizations or projects. For each 
term, guidance on the usage within a running example is provided. This document 
also defines mappings to widely used vocabularies to enable interoperability.

Scope

 This document is aimed at both publishers and consumers of Linked Data. We 
assume that the reader has a certain familiarity with RDF and RDF Schema as 
well as well-known vocabularies, such as FOAF or Dublin Core. The goal of the 
document is to specify an interoperable way to describe people and their 
relationships to other entities such as organisations or projects.

1. Introduction

This section is non-normative.

1.1 Terminology
  source data
Data from datastores such as RDBs or spreadsheets that acts as a source for 
the Linked Data publishing process.
  publisher
A person or organization that exposes source data as Linked Data on the Web.
  consumer
A person or agent that uses Linked Data from the Web.

@@TODO: point out definition of source data in the BP document 
<https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gld/raw-file/default/bp/index.html> for further details.

1.2 Conventions

The key words must, must not, required, should, should not, recommended, may, 
andoptional in this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 
2119 [RFC2119 <>].

Examples of RDF serialisations in this document are written in the Turtle [
TURTLE <>] syntax; we assume the following namespace prefix bindings unless 
otherwise stated:

xsd:http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# 
1.3 Walkthrough example

In many cases, source data <> contains data about people and other, related 
entities. We will use the following text as an example throughout the document 
to demonstrate the usage of terms:
Jane Doe is CEO of ColCids Inc., headquartered in 2242 Old Middlefield Way, 
Mountain View, CA, United States. Recently, ColCids won a contract for 
providing an Open Data platform, awarded by the Santa Clara County. The 
project, called OpenData4SantaClara, starts on 1 Feb 2013 and runs initially 
for three months. Jane's contact point in the County of Santa Clara is Björk 
Guðmundsdóttir. To ensure a successful project delivery, Jane has invited 
東海林賢蔵, a business contact and Open Data guru she recently met at a local event, 
to brief her and the CoolCids team on the challenges and requirements in the 
domain.

3. What is a person?

The core concept we are dealing with in this document is that of a person. A 
person in the context of this specification is defined as an entity of type 
foaf:Person <http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Person>.

If only the person's name is known foaf:name 
<http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_name> must be used.
<http://data.sccgov.org/people/björkg> rdf:type foaf:Person ; foaf:name "Björk 
Guðmundsdóttir" . 
How to provide further details about a person, such as an address, is 
specified in sectionrelating a person to a contact information <>. 

Best Practice 1: Deriving domain-specific person types

One sometimes finds specialisations of a person in a domain, for example, in 
the legal domain there is a distinction made between a natural person and a 
legal person. In such a case the publisher should, in addition to the 
domain-specific type (e.g.,legal:NaturalPerson) explicitly set the type 
foaf:Person in order to increase interoperability. This also allow systems that 
do not perform reasoning, for example, plain SPARQL processors to benefit from 
it.Read more ...

4. Relating a person to other entities

Beyond stating the basic characteristics of a person one can relate a person 
to atarget entity such as an organisation or project. The following sections 
normatively specify how to do this. For any target entity type not listed in 
the below sections the publisher is free to use any appropriate vocabulary. See 
also the (@@link) vocabulary selection section of theBest Practices for 
Publishing Linked Data document for guidance on how to find and select such a 
vocabulary.

ISSUE-18 <https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/18>

4.1 Relating a person to a contact information

In order to relate a person to a contact information, such as typically found 
on a business card:

 * the contact information must be represented using vCard 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/>, and 
ISSUE-22 <https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/22>

 * the link type used between a person and a contact information must be 
gldp:card <>. 
ISSUE-24 <https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/24>
@prefix gldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/people#> . @prefix : 
<http://colcids.com/person/> . :42 a foaf:Person ; gldp:card :42#bc . :42#bc a 
v:VCard ; v:fn "Jane Doe" ; ... 
4.2 Relating a person to another person

In order to relate a person to another person one must use the FOAF Vocabulary 
Specification <http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/>:

 * To state that one person knows another person, foaf:knows 
<http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_knows> must be used. 
 * To state other relationships between people, the RELATIONSHIP vocabulary 
<http://vocab.org/relationship/> should be used. <http://colcids.com/person/42> 
foaf:knows <http://opendataguru.net/me> . 
Best Practice 2: Trusting people's relationships

A foaf:knows only establishes an unidirectional claim that someone knows 
someone else. The relationshould only be considered to be of a mutual nature if 
the other person sets afoaf:knows relation as well. Read more ... 
<http://redcatco.com/blog/communication/foaf-building-networks-with-a-friend-of-a-friend/>

4.3 Relating a person to an organization

In order to relate a person to an organization one must use the Organization 
Ontology <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#>.
<http://colcids.com/company> a org:FormalOrganization . 
<http://colcids.com/person/42> a foaf:Person . _:bn123 a org:Membership ; 
org:organization <http://colcids.com/company> ; org:member 
<http://colcids.com/person/42> . 
ISSUE-19 <https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/19>

4.4 Relating a person to a building or room

In order to relate a person to a building or room one must use the Buildings 
and Rooms Vocabulary <http://vocab.deri.ie/rooms#>.

To state that a person is located in a building or room rooms:occupant 
<http://vocab.deri.ie/rooms#occupant> must be used.
@prefix rooms: <http://vocab.deri.ie/rooms#> . @prefix : <>. 
<http://colcids.com/person/42> a foaf:Person . :CCHQ a rooms:Building ; 
rooms:contains :r101 . :r101 a rooms:Room ; rooms:occupant 
<http://colcids.com/person/42> . 
ISSUE-23 <https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/23>

4.5 Relating a person to a project

In order to relate a person to a project one must use the FOAF Vocabulary 
Specification <http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/>.
@prefix gldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/people#> . @prefix xsd: 
<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> . @prefix : 
<http://data.sccgov.org/project/> . <http://data.sccgov.org/people/björkg> a 
foaf:Person . :OpenData4SantaClara a foaf:Project ; gldp:title 
"OpenData4SantaClara" ; rdfs:label "OpenData4SantaClara" ; gldp:lead 
<http://data.sccgov.org/people/björkg> ; gldp:starts 
"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ; gldp:ends 
"2013-05-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime . 
Best Practice 3: Multiple label properties

In order to enable generic Linked Data browsers, such as Tabulator 
<https://github.com/linkeddata/tabulator>, which typically hard-code well-known 
label terms to display human readable labels rather than URIs, oneshould repeat 
the content of thegldp:title's literal object in an rdfs:label literal object.

ISSUE-20 <https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/20>

4.6 Relating a person to online posts

In order to relate a person to online posts such as blog posts, mailing list 
posts, etc, onemust use the SIOC Core Ontology Specification 
<http://www.w3.org/Submission/sioc-spec/>.
@prefix sioc: <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#> . 
<http://blog.colcids.com/2012/12/01/launching-opendata4santaclara/> a sioc:Post 
; dct:title "OpenData4SantaClara will launch in early 2013" ; dct:created 
"2012-12-01T17:25:30Z" ; sioc:has_creator <http://colcids.com/person/42> . 
<http://colcids.com/person/42> a sioc:User . 
5. Terms

This section defines terms that allow to relate a person to other entities, 
such as contact information, etc. The terms below are defined in the namespace 
URIhttp://www.w3.org/ns/people# and the preferred <http://prefix.cc/gldp> 
namespace prefix for the namespace URI isgldp.

An implementer of this spec must support the following terms:

TermDefinition 
gldp:cardRelates a foaf:Person to a v:VCard; read: a person has a business card
. 
gldp:endsSpecifies the end date of a foaf:Project as an xsd:dateTime 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime> [XMLSCHEMA2 <>]; read: a project 
ends on date. 
gldp:leadRelates a foaf:Project to a foaf:Person; read: a project has a 
project lead. 
gldp:startsSpecifies the start date of a foaf:Project as an xsd:dateTime 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime> [XMLSCHEMA2 <>]; read: a project 
starts on date. 
gldp:titleSpecifies the title of a foaf:Project as an xsd:string 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#string> [XMLSCHEMA2 <>]; read: a projects 
has a title. 
6. Interoperability considerations

Our concept of a person is based on foaf:Person, but there are many more 
conceptualisations in use, for example as defined by theInteroperability 
Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA <http://ec.europa.eu/isa/>) 
project, theSchema.org <http://schema.org/> project by the search engine 
providers Bing, Google, Yahoo! or as found in the Personal Information Model 
(PIMO) by theSemantic Desktop <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/> project.

To enable interoperability and, in general, to make the data more useful, we 
define mappings of terms, in the following. An implementer of this specshould 
support these mappings.
