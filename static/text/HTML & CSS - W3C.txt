HTML <> (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS <> (Cascading Style Sheets) 
are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the
structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of 
devices. Along withgraphics <> and scripting <>, HTML and CSS are the basis of 
building Web pages andWeb Applications. Learn more below about: 

What is HTML?

HTML <> is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives 
authors the means to:

 *  Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc. 
 *  Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button. 
 *  Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in 
searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc. 
 *  Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications 
directly in their documents. 
 With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements 
of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” 
and so on.

What is XHTML?

 XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML <>, the Extensible 
Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.) as the 
HTML variant, but the syntax is slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML 
application, you can use other XML tools with it (such asXSLT, <> a language 
for transforming XML content).

What is CSS?

CSS <> is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including 
colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different 
types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is 
independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The 
separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style 
sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is 
referred to as theseparation of structure (or: content) from presentation. 

What is WebFonts?

WebFonts is a technology that enables people to use fonts on demand over the 
Web without requiring installation in the operating system. W3C has experience 
in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Until recently, downloadable 
fonts have not been common on the Web due to the lack of an interoperable font 
format. The WebFonts effort plans to address that through the creation of an 
industry-supported, open font format for the Web (called "WOFF").

Examples

 The following very simple example of a portion of an HTML document 
illustrates how to create a link within a paragraph. When rendered on the 
screen (or by a speech synthesizer), the link text will be “final report”; when 
somebody activates the link, the browser will retrieve the resource identified 
by “http://www.example.com/report”:
<p class="moreinfo">For more information see the <a 
href="http://www.example.com/report">final report</a>.</p> 
 The class attribute on the paragraph's start tag (“<p>”) can be used, among 
other thing, to add style. For instance, to italicize the text of all 
paragraphs with a class of “moreinfo,” one could write, in CSS:
p.moreinfo { font-style: italic } 
 By placing that rule in a separate file, the style may be shared by any 
number of HTML documents.
