As the Web provides many mechanisms to interlink data across systems, it is 
important that it keeps the possibility for users that want or need it, to keep 
their personal information private and fragmented.

What is Do Not Track?

 Do Not Track is a technology that lets users express their preferences around 
online tracking while browsing the Web. Advertisers, analytics, publishers and 
other online services that respect the DNT signal will limit the behavioral 
tracking of their users. By creating a simple, persistent and 
technology-neutral preference, Do Not Track will enhance users' control of 
their browsing information and improve their online privacy.

The HTTP/DOM mechanism for expressing a Do Not Track preference and policies 
for server-side compliance are both currently in the process of standardization 
in theTracking Protection Working Group <>.

What is P3P?

The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) <> enables Websites to 
express their privacy practices in a standard format that can be retrieved 
automatically and interpreted easily by user agents. P3P user agents will allow 
users to be informed of site practices (in both machine- and human-readable 
formats) and to automate decision-making based on these practices when 
appropriate. Thus users need not read the privacy policies at every site they 
visit. See thelist of P3P software <http://www.w3.org/P3P/implementations.html>.

P3P uses machine readable descriptions to describe the collection and use of 
data. Sites implementing such policies make their practices explicit and thus 
open them to public scrutiny. Browsers can help the user to understand those 
privacy practises with smart interfaces. Most importantly, Browsers can this 
way develop a predictable behavior when blocking content like cookies thus 
giving a real incentive to eCommerce sites to behave in a privacy friendly way. 
This avoids the current scattering of cookie-blocking behaviors based on 
individual heuristics imagined by the implementer of the blocking tool which 
will make the creation of "stateful" services on the web a pain because the 
state-retrieval will be unpredictable.

What is POWDER?

POWDER <> the Protocol for Web Description Resources provides a mechanism to 
describe and discover Web resources and helps the users to make a decision 
whether a given resource is of interest. There are a variety of use cases: from 
providing a better means to describing Web resources and creating trust marks 
to aiding content discovery, child protection and Semantic Web searches.
