 While the most common scripting language ECMAscript (more widely known as 
JavaScript) is developed byEcma <http://www.ecma-international.org>, a great 
many of the APIs made available in browsers have been defined at W3C.

What is scripting?

A script is program code that doesn’t need pre-processing (e.g. compiling) 
before being run. In the context of a Web browser, scripting usually refers to 
program code written in JavaScript that is executed by the browser when a page 
is downloaded, or in response to an event triggered by the user.

Scripting can make Web pages more dynamic. For example, without reloading a 
new version of a page it may allow modifications to the content of that page, 
or allow content to be added to or sent from that page. The former has been 
called DHTML (Dynamic HTML), and the latter AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and 
XML).

Beyond this, scripts increasingly allow developers to create a bridge between 
the browser and the platform it is running on, making it possible, for example, 
to create Web pages that incorporate information from the user’s environment, 
such as current location, address book details, etc.

This additional interactivity makes Web pages behave like a traditional 
software application. These Web pages are often calledWeb applications and can 
be made available either directly in the browser as a Web page, or can be 
packaged and distributed asWidgets <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/widgets>.

What scripting interfaces are available ?

The most basic scripting interface developed at W3C is the DOM 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/dom>, the Document Object Model which allows 
programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure 
and style of documents. DOM specifications form the core of DHTML.

Modifications of the content using the DOM by the user and by scripts trigger 
events <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/domevents> that developers can make 
use of to build rich user interfaces.

A number of more advanced interfaces <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/js> 
are being standardized, for instance:

 * XMLHttpRequest makes it possible to load additional content from the Web 
without loading a new document, a core component of AJAX, 
 * the Geolocation API makes the user’s current location available to 
browser-based applications, 
 * several APIs make the integration of Web applications with the local file 
system and storage seamless. 
WAI ARIA <> offers mechanisms to ensure that this additional interactivity 
remains usable independent of devices and disabilities. Additional 
considerations apply to the development ofWeb applications for mobile devices 
<http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/mobileapp>.

Beyond scripting

While scripting offers a great opportunity to develop new interfaces and 
experiment with new user interactions, over time a number of these additions 
benefit from a moredeclarative approach; for instance, instead of having each 
and every developer re-implement a calendar-interface that allows a user to 
pick a date, defining an input type (<input type='date' />) that does it 
automatically saves a lot of time and bugs, and creates a ground for further 
innovation.

Beyond the set of declarative interfaces made available through HTML <>, 
several technologies have been developed to make theseDeclarative Web 
Applications <http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/dwa> possible.
