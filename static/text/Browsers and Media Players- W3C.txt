 'User agents' - web browsers, media players, browser extensions, on-the-fly 
converters, plug-ins, bots, aggregators and mobile browsers - provide a human 
or machine interface to the web. At their best, they allow all of us to explore 
a universal space of web content.

Examples of user agent standards issues

User agent developers need to pay particular heed to issues surrounding use of 
their agents by people in other parts of the world, speaking other languages, 
using other devices and with a variety of assistive technologies that allow 
users to use different modes of input and output (such as speech input, tactile 
displays, semantic navigation, and a variety of display preferences).

Example 1: An online app developer wants to provide context-sensitive help in 
a tooltip that is displayed when the user (with a mouse) hovers over or (with a 
keyboard) focuses a "Help" icon. In most browsers, the functionality 
automatically works for hover; the title element is displayed. However, most 
browsers don't provide the same functionality for keyboard users on focus. To 
compensate for the missing functionality in the browsers, the developer has to 
create scripts to provide it for her content. Unfortunately most developers 
don't do this - and indeed, they shouldn't have to because the browser should 
provide the same functionality for people who cannot use the mouse.

Example 2: A developer uses the css declaration text-transform: lowercase to 
style a magazine headline (about fresh orange juice) originally composed in 
caps. The content is then internationalised for a Turkish-language audience, 
and a language of Turkish declared using the attributelang="tr". The lower case 
of the Turkish characterİ (a capital I dotted) should return a i. Major 
browsers, however convert the Turkish characterI to i. An innocuous headline 
"Squeeze Often" suddenly becomes rather rude...

W3C staff documented some Common User Agent Problems 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/cuap> in a Team Submission, still a useful document 
although it was published in 2003.

Accessibility Guidelines for User Agents

W3C publishes guidelines for creating accessible authoring tools: User Agent 
Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). UAAG 2.0 is intended for the current and 
future generation of user agents. You can implement the latest draft of theUser 
Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG 2.0) <http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/> by 
followingImplementing UAAG 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20/> - a 
guide to implementing and understanding the guidelines.

You may also wish to consult the current formally approved, stable and 
referenceable technical recommendation for accessibility isUAAG 1.0 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/>.

Browser developers need some help at making the web readable by all; extension 
developers can respond to limitations of particular browser functionality, and 
the best extensions can be incorporated into the browsers' standard 
functionality. Whether you develop browsers, extensions, bots, aggregators, 
media players or an as-yet undreamed of way of reading the web, to create that 
web that is readable by all, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines provide 
the place to start.
